How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?
it helped me a lot to start with git and version control.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a 
more efficient programmer in the long term?
it helps me in restoring my file to a previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?
It give us more granular control over when to save our file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each 
file separately?
It helps if the file are dependent on one another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of 
files?
I can use it easily and makes more sense now doing so.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
It makes me more confident to make change and move back to previous 
version in case of error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git 
for?
My first project.

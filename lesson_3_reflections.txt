When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When multiple people are working on same project from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?
becaus a conflict might occur...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - github to github
clone - github to local
branch - same repository multiple branches
